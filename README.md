# Independent Component Analysis Lab

In this notebook, we'll use Independent Component Analysis to retrieve original signals from three observations each of which contains a different mix of the original signals. This is the problem explained in a class during Data Scientist Nanodegree on Udacity.

## Dataset
Let's begin by looking at the dataset we have. We have three WAVE files, each of which is a mix, as we've mentioned. If you haven't worked with audio files in python before, that's okay, they basically boil down to being lists of floats.
